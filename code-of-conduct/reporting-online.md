# Stream-2022 Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide - Online Community

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to Stream-2022 by email to[*info@problemsolvingwithpython*](mailto:info@problemsolvingwithpytho ) All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all involved will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your email, please include the following information:

 * Your contact info (not required, if you would like to remain anonymous please let us know)
 * Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved If there were other witnesses besides you, try to include them as well
 * When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible. Date, time, platorm (Twitch, Github, etc) are very helpful.
 * Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a copy of the Twitch Chat) please include a link or copy and paste.
 * Any extra context you believe exists for the incident
 * If you believe this incident is ongoing or only one time
 * Any other information you believe we should have

*Note:* with anonymous reports, there are inherent limits in our ability to do follow-up or collect additional information.  Hence we suggest that if you would like to remain anonymous, you at least create a throw-away email address without your real name.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the Stream-2022 Code of Conduct Committee acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
 
 * What happened
 * Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
 * Who the individual(s) involved were
 * Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

**If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.** This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

The Code of Conduct committee will then follow the [standard procedure][enforcement.md#Resolutions] to arrive at and communicate a resolution.

## Appealing the Code of Conduct Committeeâ€™s Response

To appeal a decision of the Code of Conduct Committee, contact the Stream-2020 Council at [info@problemsolvingwithpython.com](info@problemsolvingwithpython.com) with your appeal and they will review the case.

The Steering Council will gather all relevant information from the Committee and idealy provide a resolution within two weeks.  If more time is required, the Steering Council should inform the appellant within that time frame.
